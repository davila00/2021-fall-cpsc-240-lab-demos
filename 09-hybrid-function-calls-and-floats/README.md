# Lab Demo - Stack Alignment, Function Arguments by Value and Pointer, Float Registers

This lab demo covered the following concepts:

* The basic idea and solution to crashes caused by stack alignment

* Passing arguments to C/C++ functions by value, and by reference

* Passing float arguments to functions by value

* Passing a mix of integer and float arguments to functions

* Wrapping a function call with a push/pop pair in order to preserve a register across that function call
