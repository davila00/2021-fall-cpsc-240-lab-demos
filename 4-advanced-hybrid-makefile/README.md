# TODO - Advanced Hybrid Makefile

For this demo:

* Copy source files from demo 3

* Upgrade the Makefile to utilize multiple targets

  * One target for each object file

  * Additional target for linking

  * Additional target for building (calls on the $BIN, probably)

  * Variables

  * Additional target for cleaning
