# Lab Demo - Integer Math

This demo was used to show basic mathematical operations and print their results:

* Multiply 64-bit signed integers

* Divide 64-bit signed integers

## TODO

Stuff we should still do.

* Review signed integer division again because we went over our time a few minutes and some people had to leave.

* Addition and subtraction

* Review the "inc" instruction
