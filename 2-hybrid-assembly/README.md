# Lab Demo - Hybrid Assembly

This lab demonstration was used to show the basics of creating a hybrid program. Both C and Assembly were used, with the entry point (main) appearing in the assembly source.

## TODO (optional)

If we have time, it may be a good idea to go over the following concepts:

* Makefile variables

* .PHONY targets

* Separate targets for each object file and executable (probably for a future demo, but not here)

* ```make clean```
