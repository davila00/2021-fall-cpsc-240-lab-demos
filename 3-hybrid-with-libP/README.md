# TODO: Demo 3

Try to do the following for this demo:

* Copy the previous demo (2) to start off with a basic hybrid program

* Link the libPuhfessorP shared object into the program

* Read the FUNCTIONS.md file in the libP tree with the class

* Demonstrate usage of some libP functions

* Emphasize linking multiple object files, as well as wildcard linking (i.e., *.o and *.so)

* Probably want to demonstrate math related to Assignment 1 at this point, so they can get a solid start
