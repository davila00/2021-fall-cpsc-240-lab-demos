# Lab Demo - Hybrid with libPuhfessorP

This lab demo is pending. We will show how to add the *libPuhfessorP* shared object file to your program, and some of its functionality.

Note to self: Solution for the assignments already have working examples I can draw inspiration from.

## Agenda

Try to do the following for this demo:

* Link the libPuhfessorP shared object into the program

* Read the FUNCTIONS.md file in the libP tree with the class

* Demonstrate usage of some libP functions by calling them from the assembly source code

* Emphasize linking multiple object files, as well as wildcard linking (i.e., *.o and *.so)

* Probably want to demonstrate math related to Assignment 1 at this point, so they can get a solid start

  * This Thursday, probably just talk about the concept in general (multiply input by pi-numerator, then divide result by pi-denominator), and save actual multiplication/division instructions for next week.
