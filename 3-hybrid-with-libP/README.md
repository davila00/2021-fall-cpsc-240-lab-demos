# Lab Demo - Hybrid with libPuhfessorP

This lab demo was used to show how to add the *libPuhfessorP* shared object file to your program, and some of its functionality.

Note to self: Solution for the assignments already have working examples I can draw inspiration from.

## Agenda

Stuff left to demo:

* Add in a CRLF function and use it to format output a little better

* Print user input prompt messages, before taking input

* Print confirmation after user input that contains the inputted value

* Probably want to demonstrate math related to Assignment 1 at this point, so they can get a solid start

    * Talk about the concept in general (multiply input by pi-numerator, then divide result by pi-denominator)

    * Multiplication/division instructions as well

* Make: clean

* Make: variables

* Make: PHONY targets

* Make: Multiple targets that properly utilize dependencies

  * Show why the current $(BIN) target didn't rebuild the program when appropriate

  * Fix targets so things get rebuild whenever needed (won't be required until probably Assignment 2)
