This repository is just a collection of the demonstrations presented in lab, where applicable and/or useful.

## Sub-Directories

Each subdirectory is its own demonstration and should contain all files needed for that demo. Use the Makefile inside to run building commands.

Students won't need to use the Makefile at the root of this repository. It's just for me. Feel free to study it for your own learning.
